## 📁 Project Structure Requirements

Your game must follow the standard FuzzumEngine layout:

```
YourGame/
├── Game.project
├── Assets/
├── Source/
│   ├── Core/
│   └── ...
└── Plugins/ (optional)
```

> 💡 Your `Game.project` must be valid and reference correct modules.

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- Do **not** commit `ndk/`, `BuildSettings.json`, or build outputs — they’re generated automatically.
- The build uses **NDK r25b**, **JDK 17**, and **Android SDK 33**.
- APK is built in **debug mode** (for quick iteration). For release, modify the workflow.

---

## 🛠️ Need Help?

- Ensure your `.project` path is correct.
- Check **Actions logs** if the build fails.
- Make sure `BuildToolCpp.exe` and `[BUILD]BuildEngine[Android].bat` are in the repo root (they are by default).
